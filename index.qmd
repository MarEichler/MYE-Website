# M. Y. Eichlersmith  
Hello! I'm Martha (she/her/hers) and currently I am a research programmer at Social Policy Research Associates. My job is to provide programming for data management, analysis and visualizations to a variety of teams at SPR. I completed my M.S. in Statistics at Northwestern University and my B.A. in Math at Gustavus Adolphus College. Between undergrad at graduate school, I worked for three years in investment banking. I'm originally from Minnesota and so it is no surprise that I enjoy watching hockey.
