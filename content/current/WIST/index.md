Women in Statistics (WIST) is focused on building community among self-identifying women in statistics (including any fields that use statistics or data science).  The organization seeks to increase representation of women in statistics and strives to create a mentoring environment, through professional development and learning opportunities.  

Internal Communications Chair responsibilities focus on managing communications with WIST members including:  
<ul>
  <li> Creating and distributing paper and virtual flyers  
  <li> Organizing WIST members schedules to identify optimal event times
  <li> Maintaining website  
  <li>Schedule quarterly WIST lunches
</ul>

Additionally, I worked for the
[Women in Data Science (WiDS) Chicago Regional Event](https://widschicago.org/)
by helping put together the slide deck for the event
and day-of event administration.
