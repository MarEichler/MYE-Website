Designed and create a logo for the new Women in Statistics organization.  This logo is used on a variety of marketing materials.  

In addition to the standard WIST logo, I also created a logo for the Women in Data Science (WiDS) Chicago Regional Event.  This logo was put on hex stickers and given away at the WiDS event in March 2020.
